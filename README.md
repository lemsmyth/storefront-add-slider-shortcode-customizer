# storefront-add-slider-shortcode-in-customizer
 Requires the use of the Storefront theme either as a parent theme or as a child theme. Makes it easy to add a shortcode of your favorite slider plugin right from inside the Customizer. Works with many of the popular slider plugins.
 If you just add the container to the page content it will result in a non full width slider. below the page title this plugin allows for a full width container just under the nav menu. Also adds a checkbox to easily remove the homepage title by unhooking it from the home page.
